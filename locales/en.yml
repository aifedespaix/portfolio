      javascript:
        description: >-
          JavaScript is a client-side programming language used to create
          interactive web pages. It was initially designed to add dynamic
          features to web pages, but today it is used to create complex web
          applications.
        utilisation: >-
          I used JavaScript to create interactive websites. I quickly turned to
          TypeScript to improve code quality and ease of development.

              I used Vue.js to create websites, management interfaces, and
              interactive overlays.
            apports: >-
              Vue is the framework that attracted me the most, due to its
              HTML-oriented approach to logic. It was with the arrival of Vue 3
              that I integrated it into a majority of my projects.
          react:
            description: >-

              Having worked quite a bit on AngularJS, I immediately took to the
              philosophy of NestJS. Today I use it for many backend projects,
              large or small.

            description: Firebase is a NoSQL database service for web development.
            utilisation: >-

              to allow the client to manage their content without needing
              programming knowledge. My work mainly consists of designing
              WordPress themes adapted to their needs.

        description: >-
          Full development of a chat bot for Discord and Twitch: user data
          retrieval, LLM integration, server management, and automated workflows
          via APIs. A project focused on performance, scalability, and user
          experience.
      name: Management Chat Bot
      short-description: A chat bot for Discord and Twitch
      description: >-
        A chat bot for Discord and Twitch. It allows managing Discord servers
        and Twitch chats. It can retrieve various user information and store it
        in a database. It can also interact with users.
      explains:
        '1':
          title: Data Retrieval
          description: >-
            One of the bot’s tasks is to retrieve information about users. To
            achieve this, I use the Twurple library to create a connection to
            the Twitch API, as well as the Discord.js library to connect to the
            Discord API. I collect data such as watch time, messages, commands,
            and presence times. This information is used to power a system of
            achievements and rewards, encouraging users to actively participate
            in the community.
        '2':
          title: Chat via LLM
          description: >-
            I added a chat feature using an LLM. This allows users to chat with
            the bot via messages. The bot can answer general questions but can
            also be used for more specific inquiries. It is powered by data from
            the PostgreSQL and Firebase databases. Initially, the bot was
            configured with an Ollama model, but I now use a DeepSeek model,
            which is more efficient, faster, and less resource-intensive.
      difficulties:
        '1': >-
          I started learning how to set up LLMs with Ollama, but I had
          performance issues with long response times since the model ran
          locally. Today, I use a DeepSeek model, which is more efficient.
        '2': >-
          There was a large amount of data to manage and many automations linked
          to webhooks or recurring tasks (cron). The code structure needed to be
          well-adapted to these different tasks to save time in both developing
          new features and ensuring maintenance and security.

          immersive user experience and smart technical design.
      name: Halloween Puzzle
      short-description: A collaborative investigation for Halloween.
      description: >-
        I developed a web application to spice up a Halloween night. The idea
        was to invite my community members to work together to solve a horrific
        mystery. Once the project was completed, I decided to make it publicly
        available. The puzzle starts every day at 8 PM and unfolds over four
        mysteries to solve within four hours. If all clues are found, players
        can unlock the final puzzle, available from midnight to 2 AM.

          title: CryptoJS
          description: >-
            The puzzle was designed for an online group. I knew they would try
            to inspect the code to crack the puzzles. I didn’t want to add a
            server layer to secure the data—I preferred to focus on content
            rather than security. So, I used CryptoJS to encrypt the
            information. Of course, with the data available on the frontend, all
            the decryption keys were accessible, but the process was enough to
            discourage players from trying to crack the puzzles.
      difficulties:
        '1': >-
          I integrated Twitch's API, especially the chat feature, allowing real
          interactions with users without setting up a server. I used random
          data mixed with chat messages and puzzle-related information to
          increase the challenge.

          Strong integration with the Twitch API; however, it is not the easiest
          to use, and its documentation is quite poor. Fortunately, there are
          libraries like Twurple that simplify its usage.

          Ensuring usability on both mobile and large screens required special
          adaptations due to the amount of textual information to display.

        The challenge is to provide information quickly to the player so they
        can progress efficiently. The map format was the most relevant. As it's
        a console game, the interface must be simple and ergonomic on mobile,
        while still having an adapted interface for larger screens.

          description: >-
            One of the main features is searching for points of interest via
            text input. For this, I use Fuse.js, a very powerful and fast search
            engine that handles partial words, for example.
        '2':
          title: Filtering Functionality
          description: >-
            For readability and performance reasons, it's necessary to limit the
            number of elements displayed on the map. To do this, I use a filter
            that only displays the points of interest corresponding to the
            player's search.
      difficulties:
        '1': >-
          There is a huge amount of data to display on the map, so performance
          needs to be managed.
        '2': >-
          Managing screens of different sizes, ergonomics, and UX is complicated
          because a map is not a common visual element for me to handle.
        '3': >-
          Creating the base map required cutting a gigantic image at each zoom
          level. I had to develop an algorithm to manage this cutting and
          optimize loading time.

            The goal of this mini-game is to provide a letter grid to fill in.
            Each row is associated with a description that helps players
            discover the corresponding word. There are audio and visual
            interactions to enhance the experience.
        '2':
          title: Matching Game
          description: >-
            The concept is simple: a grid of duplicated images is placed face
            down. The player must flip two images, and only one pair will be
            identical. Each attempt costs one point, and the goal is to find all
            pairs in the fewest moves possible.

          description: >-
            The sliding puzzle is a classic game. The player must move tiles to
            reconstruct the original image. The program takes an image, cuts it
            into X tiles, removes one tile, and then shuffles them in the same
            way the player needs to reassemble the image. This shuffling is done
            quickly, and the player can then solve the puzzle. I added three
            difficulty levels with different tile splits.
      difficulties:
        '1': >-
          Since these are mainly mini-games and most users are on mobile, I had
          to manage the touch system to improve the experience. Fortunately,
          JavaScript provides a very simple API for this: Touch Events, made
          even easier with the VueUse library.
        '2': >-
          To enhance the gaming experience, I implemented a lot of audio
          elements—music and sound effects. I created a small engine to manage
          them efficiently: Enable/Disable, Pause, Adjust Volume, Block
          interactions while a sound is playing, and Load assets.

            increasing difficulty until the end of the video. The whole process
            is accompanied by a 3D character that reacts to the question and
            answer. Remotion can generate a video in a few minutes, retrieving
            information stored in the database through requests to the NestJS
            server.

          description: >-
            YouTube and TikTok offer APIs for uploading videos, but they have
            access restrictions. So, I developed a NodeJS script to upload
            videos using Puppeteer, a tool for automating tasks on websites. The
            entire process—login, upload, filling in details, and scheduling the
            video—is automated.
      difficulties:
        '1': >-
          The generated voices sometimes fail, requiring manual verification of
          each result. If the voice is bad or buggy, I have to rerun the AI with
          a new seed.
        '2': >-
          Since the video upload system is automated through a script using a
          virtual browser, any update to the YouTube or TikTok interface can
          potentially break the script.
        '3': >-
          I initially thought the content would attract a certain audience due
          to the quality of the videos compared to competing channels. However,
          the lack of exposure led me to stop publishing new videos.
